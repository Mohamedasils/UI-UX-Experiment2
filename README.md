## Algorithm:
## step1:Requirement Analysis

  Identify the purpose of the logo (Football Club branding).
  
  Define target audience (sports fans, players, community).
  
  Decide on theme (strength, energy, competition).

## step 2:Branding Guidelines

Select colors that represent passion and strength (Red + White).

Choose typography: bold, sans-serif, easy to read.

Decide shape: shield (represents strength and protection).

Add icon: classic football/soccer ball.

## step 3:Design Process

Open a design platform (e.g., Canva, Figma, Photoshop).

Create a shield shape as the base.

## step 4:Add text:

Top → CFC (Chennai Football Club abbreviation).

Bottom → Full club name (CHENNAI FOOTBALL CLUB).

Insert a football icon in the center of the shield.

## step 5:Apply Gestalt Principles

Proximity → Group football + text inside shield.

Similarity → Use consistent font and color scheme.

Figure/Ground → White text on red background for high contrast.
